## v0.28.0
**NOTE** - Beginning with this release, a subset of the source code in the
[github.com/brimsec/zq](https://github.com/brimsec/zq) GitHub repository is
covered by a source-available style license, the
[Polyform Perimeter License (PPL)](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/perimeter/1.0.0/).
We've moved the PPL-covered code under a `ppl/` directory in the repository.
The majority of our source code retains the existing BSD-3-Clause license.

The overwhelming majority of zq/zqd users and developers will not be impacted
by this change, including those using zq/zqd in commercial settings. The use of
the source-available Polyform Perimeter license prevents use cases like
marketing a work as a "as-a-service" style offering for server components like
zqd while using material covered under the PPL.

In general, we are making this change to ensure technology giants can't use the
PPL-covered code to make replacement offerings of our projects. We believe
users and developers should have access to the source code for our projects,
and we need a sustainable business model to continue funding our work. Using
the source-available Polyform Perimeter license on portions of the source code
lets us realize both. 

For more detail regarding licensing, see the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/brimsec/zq/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
doc, and feel free to come talk to us on
[Slack](https://www.brimsecurity.com/join-slack/) if you have additional
questions.
